# API Mapping Project

This project is a collection of API mappings for various websites, automatically generated by an AI agent using the Chrome DevTools Model-Context-Protocol (MCP). Each directory in the `APIs/` folder represents a different website and contains a complete set of documentation for its API.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate a rapid, automated process for reverse-engineering and documenting the private APIs used by websites. By using an AI agent with browser control, we can map out API endpoints, authentication methods, and data structures in a fraction of the time it would take to do so manually.

## Mapped APIs

Currently, the following APIs have been mapped:

- bsf.dk
- byg-erfa.dk
- bygningsreglementet.dk
- ens.dk
- knauf-dk
- membran-erfa.dk
- rockwool-dk
- sparenergi.dk
- traeinfo.dk

Each of these directories contains a full set of documentation, including an OpenAPI specification, a README, a workbook, and code examples.

## How to Use This Data

The mapped API data in this project can be used for a variety of purposes, from data integration and analysis to building new applications. Here's a debate on the potential uses, including the "why" and "how":

### Why Use This Mapped API Data?

The fundamental reason to use this data is to **programmatically access information and functionality that is otherwise only available through a website's user interface**. This opens up a world of possibilities for automation, data analysis, and application development.

For example, with the `sparenergi.dk` API, you can access energy label data for buildings in Denmark. Manually looking up this information for hundreds of properties would be incredibly time-consuming. With the API, you can automate this process, saving time and enabling large-scale data analysis.

### How Can This Data Be Used?

Here are some specific ways you could use the mapped API data:

#### 1. Data Integration and Enrichment

-   **What**: Combine data from these APIs with your own datasets to enrich your data.
-   **How**: If you have a list of properties, you could use the `sparenergi.dk` API to add energy label information to each property. This could be used by real estate agents to provide more detailed listings, or by construction companies to identify potential customers for energy-efficient renovations.
-   **Example**: A Python script could read a CSV file of addresses, call the `sparenergi.dk` autocomplete API to find the correct address, and then navigate to the details page to extract the `EnergyLabelSerialIdentifier`. With this identifier, it could then call the `emoweb.dk` API to download the PDF report for each property.

#### 2. Building New Applications and Services

-   **What**: Create new applications that leverage the functionality of the mapped APIs.
-   **How**: You could build a mobile app that allows users to quickly look up the energy label of a property by taking a picture of the address. The app would use OCR to extract the address, call the `sparenergi.dk` API to get the energy label data, and then display it in a user-friendly format.
-   **Example**: A web application could be built that aggregates data from multiple APIs in this project. For instance, it could combine building regulation information from `bygningsreglementet.dk` with energy label data from `sparenergi.dk` to provide a comprehensive overview of a property's energy efficiency and compliance with building codes.

#### 3. Data Analysis and Research

-   **What**: Perform large-scale data analysis to uncover trends and insights.
-   **How**: A data scientist could use the `sparenergi.dk` statistics endpoint to gather data on the distribution of energy labels across different municipalities, building types, and construction years. This could be used to identify areas with low energy efficiency and target them for energy-saving initiatives.
-   **Example**: A Jupyter notebook could be used to make repeated calls to the statistics endpoint with different filter combinations. The data could then be loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis and visualization with libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.

### A Word of Caution

While these APIs are publicly accessible, they are not officially documented or supported for third-party use. This means that they could change or be removed at any time without notice. Any application built on top of these APIs should be designed to handle such changes gracefully. Always respect the terms of service of the websites you are interacting with.
